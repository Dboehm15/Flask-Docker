# Flask-Docker

## Run app locally
Just run main.py

## Run app in docker
Assuming you have docker installed already just use engine.py. The arguement options are start, stop, ps.
EXAMPLES: 
-python main.py start
-python main.py stop
-python main.py ps

## Required libraries
Eventually I will add a requirements.txt so these can been auto-installed, but for now just pip install flask and pip install requests

## IDE
I haven't fully figured out the .gitignore list, so for now a few of my IntelliJ files are being updated in the repo every time I commit. The good news is that means that if you use IntelliJ for this project you'll get a preset of some of the settings I use.
